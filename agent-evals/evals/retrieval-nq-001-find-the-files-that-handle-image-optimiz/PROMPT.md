You are performing code localization in the Next.js codebase.
Given the query below, identify the most relevant source files.

## Query

Find the files that handle image optimization and responsive image loading

## Instructions

- Search the codebase to find files that are most relevant to the query
- Focus on implementation files (`.ts`, `.tsx`), not type declarations (`.d.ts`)
- Order results by relevance, most relevant first
- Include up to 10 file paths

## Output

Write your answer to `answer.json` as a JSON array of file paths relative to the repository root, ordered by relevance (most relevant first). Maximum 10 paths.

Example:
```json
["src/server/some-file.ts", "src/client/another-file.tsx"]
```
