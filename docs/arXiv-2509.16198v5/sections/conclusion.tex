\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented the Repository Planning Graph (\graph), a structured representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning for repository generation. Built on \graph{}, we introduced \ours{}, a graph-driven framework that achieves state-of-the-art coverage, correctness, and scalability on the RepoCraft benchmark. Our analyses show that \graph{} models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling of functionality and code size, and improves agents’ repository understanding, thereby accelerating localization. These results highlight the potential of graph-based representations as a foundation for advancing long-horizon and large-scale repository generation.
